## Benefits of moving to cloud computing
- Trade capital expense for variable expense
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Stop guessing about capacity
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes
	
### Note that:
- You do not gain greater control of the infrastructure layer as AWS largely control this
- Though AWS is compliant with lots of security compliance programs, not all programs in all local countries will be included
	
## Cost considerations when moving to AWS
- AMIs of the servers (Some have licensing fees)
- Instance types of the servers / Compute hardware
- The number of servers migrated (you will reduce the physical management of these)
- Compute capacity of the database server
- Amount of data egress
- No charge for VPCs, IAM users or data ingress
- Data center security
- The following have to be paid both for on-premises and the cloud so there is little difference
    - Firewall management
    - Application licensing
    - Operating system patching
	
## Benefits of using the AWS Managed Services
- Provides simple and efficient means to make controlled changes to your infrastructure
- Enables you to quickly and easily make the request through a dedicated self-service console

- You can bring products to market faster

## Agility of AWS Cloud
- Pay as you go
- Infrastructure scalability; use resources based on demand (teminate whenever required)
	
### AWS Free Tier enables you to gain free, hands-on experience with the AWS platform, products, and services and is valid of 12 months
	
### Instance type is determined by the amount of CPU and Memory that is allocated to the instance.

## AWS Regions
- Geographical areas that are used to host resources
- Each region consists of 2 or more availability zones
- Each region is designed to be completely isolated form the other Amazon Regions
- Use multiple Regions when application is mission critical and afford little downtime , even in case of disaster (ie. high availability)
- If you need to have a disaster recovery mechanism in place , then plan to place your resources in multiple regions
- Have direct, low-latency, high throughput and redundant network connections between each other
- You should put resources in regions closest to the customer for lower latency and better user experience
- VPCs exist within accounts on a per region basis
- You can get 5 Elastic IP addresses per region by default
	
## AWS Availability Zones
- Logical representations of one or more data centers
- They are physically separate and isolated from each other
- Good to use multiple AZs for high availability and fault tolerance
- In case a Region goes down you should use AZs in multiple Regions to increase fault tolerance
- They have direct, low-latency, high throughput and redundant network connections between each other
- You can create one or more subnets within each Availability Zone

## AWS Data Center
- Physical location where the hardware is placed for hosting AWS resources

---
# PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
## AWS Management Console
- Allows you to manage services through a web-based user interface
- The link to access the AWS Management Console is https://AWSAccountID.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
- You need a user name and password to log in

## Amazon EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute)
- The equivalent of a virtual server
- EC2 servers are placed in the AWS Virtual Private Cloud.
- You only pay for what you use
- To enabling an EC2 web server to serve web pages on the Internet you need to configue
    - Security group rules configured to allow HTTP/HTTPS
    - A public IP address assigned to an instance in a public subnet
    - An Internet Gateway attached to the VPC
    - An entry in the route table for the subnet that points to it
- A private IP address will always be assigned to instances in EC2, but these do not enable access from the Internet
- You cannot add a public elastic IP address to an EC2 instance in a private subnet or update security group rules to allow connectivity
    - Deploy a bastion host server into a public subnet and use that to jump across from the public subnet to the private subnet
- Key pairs are created in EC2 and are used for encrypting logon information when loging in to EC2 instances
    - Key Pairs unique to the region in which you have created them
    - A key pair is required to decrypt the Administrator password of a newly launched Amazon EC2 Windows instance
        - You can decrypt it through the console or using the CLI
- A primary key is required to securely log into Linux-based instances
- An access key and secret ID are associated with IAM accounts and are used for signing programmatic requests
- For Windows based instances, the private key file can be used to generate a password

    - Key (name of the object)
    - Value (data made up of a sequence of bytes)
    - Version ID (used for versioning)
    - Metadata (data about the data that is stored)
- You can create folders within buckets and also upload objects
- HTTP responses when uploading an object:
    - 200 codes indicates a successful upload
    - 300 code indicates a redirection
    - 400 code indicates a client error
    - 500 code indicates a server error
- Automatically scales in both capacity and performance as required
    - You don't need to specify any capacity at any time
- Provides maximum availability and durability
- Use to store critical objects or files
- For storing of objects such as files, videos and pictures (even when they will be processed at a later time)

- Use MFA delete to add a layer of additional security to prevent accidental deletion
- Available data consistency models
    - Read after write consitency for PUTS of new objects
    - Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES
- Can be used as a static website
    - Use Bucket Policies to make the entire bucket public
    - Ensure that you are not blocking access at the account level
    - The minimum files you need to upload are:
        - Index.html
        - Error.html
- Data never leaves that region unless explicitly configured to do so through cross-region replication (CRR)
    - Configured at the bucket level
    - Versioning must be enabled for both the source and destination buckets
- Objects within a bucket are replicated within a region across multiple AZs (except for the One-Zone IA class)

            - You transfer gigabytes to terabytes of data on a regular basis across continents
            - You underutilize the available bandwidth over the Internet when uploading to Amazon S3
- Accessed via RESTful protocol over HTTP
    - HTTPS protocol is used if you want to encrypt files as they are transmitted over the Internet to an Amazon S3 bucket
        - HTTPS works on port 443 and requires an SSL Certificate
- You can use Lifecycle Management to automatically move objects from one storage class to another
- S3 Event Notifications is a feature that notifies you when certain events happen in your S3 bucket
- You need to grant public access and read/write access if you want to be able to access files over a web browser
    - Also ensure that you are not blocking access at the account level
- Use the AWS Configure command and your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key to enable full S3 access from an EC2 Instance

- By default new users are created with NO access to any AWS services â they can only login to the AWS console
- Best practices
    - Create individual IAM users
    - Grant least privilege
        - Determine what users need to do and then craft policies for them that let the users perform only those tasks

- A key pair is required to decrypt the Administrator password of a newly launched Amazon EC2 Windows instance
- All you can do with an access key once it has been generated is to make active, make inactive, or delete it
- Best practices for managing access keys:
    - Don't generate an access key for the root account
    - Where possible, use IAM roles with temporary security credentials

### IAM Users
- An entity that represents a person or service
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and password expiry to secure IAM credentials

- Define a set of permissions for making AWS service requests
- You cannot apply multiple roles to a single instance
- Benefits of using IAM roles for applications that run on EC2 instances
    - They are more secure than storing access keys within applications
    - It is easier to manage IAM roles

### IAM Groups (Security Groups)

- Stateful
- Operate at the instance level
- Types of rules that can be defined in a security group are:
    - Outbound
    - Inbound
- You cannot nest groups (groups within groups)
- Use groups to assign permissions to users
- Define rules that the traffic which can flow inside of EC2 Instances
- Stateful meaning that if traffic is allowed in one direction
    - The return traffic is automatically allowed regardless of whether there is a matching rule for the traffic
- You can use these to secure access for Adminstrators from only certain workstations
- In a default configuration
    - Security Groups allow only outbound traffic and block all incoming traffic
        - You need to enable inbound traffic specifying the protocol, port and source
- Security Groups are applied at the Instance level
- Provides a firewall/security layer at the Instance level
- Can be used to enable traffic flow between different types of instances within a subnet itself (which NACLs cannot control)
- Security groups are an instance-level firewall used for controlling access to AWS resources
- Benefits of IAM Groups
    - Enables you to attach IAM permission to more thatn one user at a time
    - Lets you specify permissions for multiple user

### IAM Policies

- Permissions determine whether the request is allowed or denied
- Define permissions and can be applied to users, groups and roles
    - Ex. can use to grant read/write access to an Amazon S3 bucket
- IAM policies are written in JSON
- Use condition elements to build expressions in which you use condition operators (equal, less than, etc.) to match the condition in the policy
    - Condition values can include date, time, the IP address of the requester, etc.
- Tools to create IAM policies include
    - Import a Managed Policy
    - JSON Scripting
    - Visual Editor

---	
#INSTANCE PRICING
###	On-Demand instances
- Most flexible because you can spin up and terminate resources as needed
- Good for testing environment
- Best choice for this situation as it is the most economical option that will ensure no interruptions
	
### Reserved instances
- Beneficial for production workloads where you know that you are going to be utilizing resources for a longer period of time
- Good for long-term, static requirements as you must lock-in for 1 or 3 years in return for a decent discount
- Types of reserved instances
    - Standard RIs
        - Provides the most significant discount (up to 75% off On-Demand) and are best suited for steady-state usage
    - Convertible RIs
        - Provides a discount (up to 54% off On-Demand) 
        - Provides capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of RIs Instances of equal or greater value
        - No limits to how many times you perform an exchange
        - Like Standard RIs, Convertible RIs are best suited for steady-state usage
    - Scheduled RIs
        - Available to launch within the time windows you reserve
        - Allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, a week, or a month
- You cannot redeem your reserved instances, however, you can sell them on the AWS marketplace
	
### Spot instances
- Use for workloads where the availability of the EC2 instance can be flexible or your applications can be interrupted
- Good for scenarios where you have batch processing needs
- Good for short term requirements as they can be very economical
- Most cost effective EC2 pricing option to use for non-critical overnight workload
- Sometimes AWS may terminate your instance, e.g. when the market price exceeds your bid price.
- You bid on a particular price, known as the bid price
- You will actually pay the spot price which will either be the same as your bid price or lower
    - If the spot price rises above your bid price, then you will lose the instance
- Billing timeframes for on-demand EC2 instances are:
    - Per hour
    - Per second (for some Linux types)
	
### Dedicated hosts
- Dedicated hardware that is fully reserved for the AWS customer
    - Dedicated Instances are also dedicated , but this only at the Instance level, ie the hardware is still shared with other AWS customers.
- Can help reduce your costs as you can utilize your existing server licenses
- Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
- Expensive

### Dedicated Instances
- Amazon EC2 instances that run in a VPC on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer

---
# DESIGN CONCEPTS
- Design with failure in mind.
    - Look at bottlenecks and the ways that things can fail
    - Deploy application across multiple availability zones
- Decouple - reduce inter-dependencies (non-monolithic)
    - Ensure that components are lightly coupled across distributed components
    - So failures don't impact availaility
    - In tightly coupled system a failure in one component could cause a failure in other components
    - Concept of loose coupling includes "well-defined interfaces" which reduce interdependencies in a system by enabling interaction only through specific, technology-agnostic interfaces (e.g. RESTful APIs)
    - Asynchronous integration is recommended so an interaction does not require an immediate response
    - You should use standard, technology-agnostic interfaces rather than proprietary interfaces where possible
    - DNS names are used for service discovery
        - Disparate resources must have a way of discovering each other without prior knowledge of the network topology
        - Using DNS names for end points instead of using IP Address ensures flexibility for failover
- The maximum level of fault tolerance is having your application distributed across multiple availability zones in 2 regions.
- Least privilege principle - start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary
- Elasticity is how flexible your application is to demand (Ability to scale up and down)

    - Security Groups
    - Data ingress to the AWS cloud
    - Power
    - There are no termination fees

- The following can be used to configure AWS cloud services
    - AWS and Individual Service Console
    - Command Line Interface (CLI)
    - Application Programming Interface (API)

- Problems associated with using Access Key ID and Secret Access Keys when trying to grant access to AWS services
    - Keys might get leaked and fall into the wrong hands
    - Rotation of keys

- Use a failover routing policy can redirect traffic to a secondary site.

- Real-time audting
    - You can use AWS Lambda, Amazon EMR, the Amazon Elasticsearch Service, or third-party tools from the AWS Marketplace to implement real-time auditing by using Lambda to to scan logs to detect things like 
        - Unused permissions
        - Overuse of privileged accounts
        - Usage of keys
        - Anomalous logins
        - Policy violations
        - System abuse
    -You can also use Amazon Inspector to monitor for compliance

- Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) uniquely identify AWS resources
    - We require an ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as
        - IAM policies
        - Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) tags
        - API calls

- **AWS Limits**
    - The instance limits are:
        - Running up to a total of 20 On-Demand instances across the instance family
        - Purchasing 20 Reserved Instances
        - Requesting Spot Instances per your dynamic Spot limit per region
    - If a user did not have permissions to launch an instance then it will terminate rather than launs

- An application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software.

- **NAS server is Network Attached Storage.**

- Reliability pillar of the well-architected framework
    - Test recovery procedures
    - Automatically recover from failure
    - Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
    - Stop guessing capacity
    - Manage change in automation
	
  #### Five pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework
1. Operational excellence
2. Security
3. Reliability
4. Performance efficiency
5. Cost optimization	
    - Adopt a consumption model
    - Stop spending money on data center operations
    - Analyze and attribute expenditure
    - Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership

- If you have an application that requires access to specialized hardware you need to build it on-premise in a private cloud.

- To block access to a known list of IP addresses you can
    - Configure a local firewall (such as iptables) on the web server
    - Use Network ACL deny rules

- Authenticate using AWS APIs can be accomplished by
    - Server certificates
    - Access keys

- You can connect from your on-premise data center to a VPC via
    - Direct Connect
    - VPN CloudHub

- **HIPAA (U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) compliance** 
    - Relates to the regulatory requirements of how patient records are stored
    - Allows the AWS environment to process, maintain, and store protected health information

- A server password cannot be used to authenticate with an API.
- 
- Server certificates are SSL/TLS certificates that you can use to authenticate with some AWS services

- Jenkins deploys infrastructure as code but is not an AWS service.
