## GitHub

- GitHub is a place to share your code with the world.
- Allows employers to see what you're capable of.
-

- On the top right of your profile page click on the "Custom your pins" link.
- Pick yoour best projects and projects that you have worked on.
- You can sort them on the profile page by drag-and-dropping them.

### GitHub pages and working demos

- Lets you turn your code into a working demo directly on GitHub free of charge.
- Set up and deployment is really fast.
- Only supports static sites and apps so no backend of full stack projects.
- How to do it:
  1. Push code to GitHub.
  2. Click the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** block.
  3. Select the source and click "Save".
  4. This creates a url for the project.
  5. Copy the url and navigate to the "Code" tab.
  6. Click the "Edit" button, paste the url in the box and click "Save".
  7. Fill out the description. Be as complete as possible.
- Always have a working demo for each pinned project.
- You can also click on the "Manage topics" button and add them.

### Sharing full stack and backend projects

- You can host them on places like **Heroku**,the cloud or a place like **Namecheap**.
- You can still paste in the website link like you did for the projects hosted on GitHub.

### Personal section

- **Personal details matter!**
- Click on the top right icon and "Settings" from the dropdown.
- Fill in Nname, Public email, Bio, URL, Company, and Location.
- For the URL you can put in your portfolio or your personal website.
- Sample Bio:

```
Fulltime fullstack web developer, author, instructor and YouTub webdev personality.
Say Hi to me on YY: https://tinyurl.com/...
```

  - You can put in something clever like "Near a Text Editor at Any Given Moment"
- Click the **Available for hire** checkbox to increase your visibility.
- Don't forget to click the "Update Profile" button when you are done.
- Choose a photo.
  - It doesn't have to be a photo of yourself. That can be used for discrimation.
  - You can get artistic if you like.

## Contributions box

- To get your contributions up document your code or add commenting.
  - This not only gets your contributions up but it improves your code.
  - Only 5 minutes a day can make a big difference.

### Proofread and test the repository that you want potential employers to see.

## Polishing Your Portfolio

- Your portfolio is a collection of your best work.
- Your portfolio is a project in itself.
- There is no recommended or standardized platform for web developer portfolios.
  - WordPress
  - Skeleton: Responsive CSS Biolerplate
  - Bootstrap:
  - Static site generators like StaticGen, Jekyll
    - If you use a static site you can deploy it directly from GitHub.
- Use something that you like and are excited about.

### Universal portfolio considerations

- The site needs to be fast.
  - Compress images. Don't weigh it down with plugins. Use a reputable hosting site.
- Emphasize your personal branding.
  - Don't get lost in the heap.
  - Employers are looking at a lot of portfolios so remind them who created it.
- Make a contact form.
  - Test it before going live.
- Simple navigation
  - You want to efficiently control your flow of information.
  - Be cognitive of how you're directing your users.
- Themes work!
  - Save time
  - Lead to better user experiences
  - Repsonive and support multiple browsers right out of the box.
- Domain name should be easy to spell and remember.

### Portfolio content

- It's not just about the code.
  - It's about your **decisions** behhid the code and understanding the impact.
- The best projects solve a problem.
  - Only include your best projects.
- Play to your ideal company ("hot stack" startup, commerce shop, etc.)
  - Employers want to see projects in their stack that solve a problem.
  - Employers want to see as explicitly as possible how you can solve problems for them.
- Include 5 to 6 projects.
  - Allows you to pick projects from multiple domains.
  - Limit so you won't have to struggle to remember a project a potential employer brings up in an interview.
- Context is critically important.
  - Add a few screenshots and link to the sites.

### **PAR** / **PSR** (Problem-Action-Result / Problem-Solution-Result)

- State an problem, explain the action and then share the result.
- PAR is a multi-step process that gives your projects context.
- Similar to a case study.
- PARs are more modular than case studies so they're easier to implement and have a focused format.
- Allows you to quickly extract and explain the relevance of your projects.
  - You never want your employer to go out of their way to learn about you.
- Can also use Challenge-Solution-Outcome, if you like that wording better.
- You can link to the GitHub repo for each project, if you like.

## Searching and Applying for Jobs

### Legitimate job sites for jr. developers

- [https://stackoverflow.com/jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs)
- [https://www.indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com)
- [https://linkedin.com/jobs/](https://linkedin.com/jobs/)
- [https://css-tricks.com/jobs/](https://css-tricks.com/jobs/)
- [https://vuejobs.com](https://vuejobs.com)
- [https://jobs.github.com/positions](https://jobs.github.com/positions)
- Individual company websites

### Before applying, get strategic

- Does your city of choice have jobs for your stack?
- Relocation is expensive; start saving now.
- Write down the basic requirements you have (location, stack, size of company, etc.)
- Explore site's filtering systems to filter out irrelevant jobs
- Bookmark the positions. Don't apply just yet. Do all of your applying on a set deployment day.

- Many times the job listings are written by non-technical people.
- Apply if you think it's a job you can handle or learn to handle even if you aren't an exact fit.
- Never let nice-to-have lists keep you from applying.

### Expanding job search via networking

- **Meetups**
  - Web developer meetups are a great way to get connected with those in the industry.
  - Meetups are organized through the website [meetups.com](https://meetups.com)
  - In nearly every city.
  - A lot of times they'll include a speaker and food and beverages.
  - Low pressure.
  - You can send an email to the organizer and let them know about you and your situation.

* **LinkedIn**
  - The go-to-site for professional networking.
  - Recruiters love this site. Your responsibility is to get noticed.
    - Fill out everything.
    - Make at least 50 industry related connections.
    - Education section should include certificates related to we development. (Treehouse, freeCodeCamp, Udemy, etc.)
    - You can link to your portfolio and GitHub and include screenshots of your projects.
    - Hoist your development related experience to the top of the experience section.
    - Trigger the LinkedIn algorithm by including keywords related to your tech specialty without sounding unnatural.
    - Issue an explicit call to action to the recruiter in the summary.
    - Recruiters can connect you to job opportunities but they don't necessarily making getting into the company any easier.

- **Discussion Boards & Social Media**
  - Follow the community based forums on Codeacademy, freeCodeCamp, Treehouse, etc.
  - Assert yourself. Help others out with your knowledge.
  - Get strategic with your signature block.
  - Make it easy for people to contact you.
  - Techies love Twitter. Work the circuit with retweets, #hashtags, and @mentions.
  - You want to keep your social media tech focused.

### Deployment Day

- Have a dedicated day to apply for jobs.
- This gives you a chance to research the companies and trim down your job list.
- Try to apply to at least 15 jobs on the dame day.
- Craft your material earlier in the week. Customize the names, change the cover letter dates into individual folders.
- When you have a single deployment day the callbacks, interviews and callbacks tend to come around the same time.
  - You can use this to your advantage when negotiating a salary, etc.

## Post Application Process

- You will apply to a lot of jobs so it's nearly impossible to keep track of them all.
- Use a spreadsheets to keep track of jobs.
  - If frees up our brain's RAM.
  - It is a dynamic document.

### Job application spreadsheet

- Include the following seven columns:
  1. Company Name
  2. Date Applied
  3. Like (1-4)
  4. Stage (Applied/Phone Hello/Phone Tech/On Site/Offered)
  5. Point of Contact
  6. Job
  7. Location
- Everytime you apply to a job update the spreadsheed with as much information as possible.
- If you are rejected or the job is not longer available remove it from the live list and put it below with the update info.

## The email check-in

- Don't let waiting for response emails keep you from applying and your regular job search and deployment day.
- Like a follow-up email, but more proactive.
- Sent to strangers before any prior personal interaction.
- Plants a digital seed that says "I'm interested."
- Don't do this earlier than 7 days.
- Shows that you're a motivated and live candidate.
- Needs to be assertive yet non-pushy
- Crafting a check-in email.
  - Find the point of contact for the job in your spreadsheet.
    - If you don't have one go to the company website and look for the human resources department.
    - If you still can't find it then use the general inquire address.
    - Example:

```
To: hello@hiremegrace.com
Subject: Timeline for Applicants (Quick Question)

Hi weWantVueDevs,

Robin O'Bryan here. I applied to your frontend web developer opening recently and just wanted to check in with you to express my continued interest in the position.

Is there a timeline I can expect for the first round of candidate callbacks/interviews? Thanks for your time and I look forward to talking soon!

Robin

```

- You don't need to make yourself look overly motivated or desperate.

### Callbacks and Emailbacks

- Check your emails first thing every morning and your phone messages.
- That call or email is one of two messages:
  1. "Thanks, but no thanks."
  2. "We want to talk more."
- **Don't let rejection compel you to quit!** It happens to everybody.
- Do not let the casual tone fool you: this is the start of the formal interview process.
  - Many time the word "talk" is an informal way to indicate an interview.
- Sample email response.

## Interviews

- Employers want employees to do two things.
  1. Make the business money
  2. Save the business money

### STAR METHOD

- **Situation** - Detail the background. Provide a context. Where? When?
  - Keep the situation related to web development.
- **Task** - Describe the challenge and expectations. What needs to be done? Why?
- **Action** - Elaborate your specific action. What did you do? How? What tools did you use?
- **Results** - Explain the results: accomplishments, recognition, savings, etc. Quantify.
- Allows you to quickly organize your answer while succinctly describing the process that you used to solve a problem.
- Not all questions are appropriate for the STAR method.
  - Purely technical questions don't require a narrative.
- STAR is best applied to open-ended questions.

### Types of interview questions

- **Behavioral** (can be technical or soft-skills related)
- **Algorithms**
- **Programming principles**
- **OO design patterns**
- **Experience with the company's tech stack**
- **Familiarity with current tech**
- **Deep dive into your portfolio** (be prepared to explain your decisions behind your code)
- **"Trivia** tech (i.e. the difference between double and triple equal signs in JS)
- **You** (be prepared to talk about yourself - be proud!)

### Best way to prepare: practice, practice, practice

- Practice speaking in front of a mirror
- Practice with a friend or family member
- Links to tech questions:
  - [Front-end Job Interview Questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions)

- You might also be given a coding challenge
  - Can be "live"
  - Can also be a take-home challenge
  - Exact coding challenge varies by company
  - Challenges may include:
    - Recreate a website
    - Turning word problems into code or made into an app
    - Refactor bad code

#### For take-home challenges

- Any resource is fair game (Google, your mentor, Stack Overflow, etc.)

#### For real-time coding challenges

- The interviewers want to see and hear your process. (Process is more important than getting the answer correct.)
- Think aloud. Walk them through.
- CRITICAL: Be verbal.
- Ask questions about your assumptions before starting.
- Use appropriate techniccal terms and formal names.
- Use semantic naming conventions.

### Interviewing the interviewer

- This interview is also about you asking questions for your benefit.
- Feel free to ask questions like:
  - What's the company's culture like?
  - Do you have a formal training process?
  - Who will be my tech leads?
  - What's the workflow like?
  - ... and any other questions that inform you about the company, its people and its products.
- **Bring a pen and notepad** and be prepared to take a lot of notes.

### Interview environments

- Phone screen -> realtime video (Skype, Google Hangouts, etc.) -> in person -> decision
- Phone screen -> in-person -> decision
- Realtime video screen -> technical phone interview -> decision
- Realtime video screen -> in-person -> decision
- Realtime video -> decision
- In-person -> decision

#### Each environment has it's on requirements.

### Video Environment Checklist

- Find a quiet place with a strong wi-fi signal or hard-wired.
- Stick to laptops and desktops (no cellphones)
- Choose a clean, non-distracting background with ample lighting.
- Video apps are power hods - plug in your laptop (also reduces fan noise)
- Ensure camera and microphone are operational.
- Do a "dry run" with a friend or family member.
- HAVE A BACKUP PLAN (land line, backup smartphone, etc.)

### In-Person Interview Checklist

- Confirm the interview location. (Sometimes they aren't on site.)
- Do a "dry-run" to drive (or take public transportation) to the interview location.
  - Check parking options.
  - Don't forget money if it's metered.
  - Consider the traffic situation. (Map an alternate route in case of bad traffic.)
  - Leave early enough to get there 15 minutes early.

#### Final Interview Tips

- The more you plan for interviews the more confident and less anxious you will be.
- Remember the company just wants to confirm that you're the right choice.

## Follow-Up Email

- You survived the interview.
- Follow-up message does the following five things:
  1. Tells the company that you're still interested in the position
  2. Emphasize your communication skills
  3. Give you an opportunity to add any information you forgot to include at the interview
  4. Give you an opportunity to clarify something that you said in the interview
  5. Invite the interviewers to get in touch with you if they have further questions
- Sample folow-up email

```

Subject: Fullstack Dev Interview

Hi Rosa,

Thanks for meeting with me on Tuesday. It was great getting to meet you and learning more about the company.

I'm very much interested in the fullstack web developer position. Plus, I just started playing around with Sequelize and am absolutely loving it for PostgreSQL! No wonder you listed this as a nice-to-have skill.

If you have any ore questions about anything, I would be happy to answer them.

Thanks again, and looking forward to talking soon.

Jonas
```

- It should be a little friendlier than full-on professional because you should be establishing a rapport with the interview team.
- Reinforce your interest in the job while highlighting your assertiveness.

## Job Offer and Salary Negotiation

- Awkward, but expected.
- Most negotiation books are for investors outside the tech industry.
- Get simple and strategic.
- Go back to the salaries that companies have offered you.
  - You probaby have your top company pick from all of those offers.
  - Assess the salaries of the other offers, research on Paysa & Glassdoor, ask your mentor, etc what "good" salaries for the area and position are.
- When you don't like the starting salary of the company you want to work for:
  1. Once again list off your skills that will make and save money - be assertive, but personable.
  2. Go bullet point by bullet point.
  - Honesty goes a long way: "You're my top pick and I really want this to work."
  - The company has three options:
    1. Accept
    2. Counteroffer
       - Weigh your options
       - Ask if they'll thow in an extra perk (Like a day of remote work or something else)
       - Feeling bold? Counteroffer the counteroffer.
    3. Stick to original offer
    - Being lowballed sucks but do some acessing
      - Not exciting, but could be valuable
      - Low salary doesn't have to be forever
      - Could you be acquiring new technical and leadership skills?
        - Gain skills and find a better job with another company.
      - You could always ask for a raise several months in if you're exceeding expectations.
- By not negotiating you're cheapening your dream and selling yourself short.
- **Get your final salary amount in writing**

## Your First Week on the Job

- Orientation - meeting your bosses, co-workers and others
- Get employee badge, an office tour, paperwork
- Possible training
- Setting up your development environment
  - This will take a while and things will go wrong. Be patient.
  - Keep a positive attitude
- Explore the code and take notes of coding practices, etc.
- ssh key generation and pushing code, pulling code
- Command line operations
- You may be working with Slack, Teams or another group messaging application
- Basic git or whatever version control they are using
- **TAKE LOTS OF NOTES AND ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS**

## Minimizing Discrimination

### Age-Related Discrimination

- No extremes - just a little numbers tweaking.
- Remove graduation dates and other dates that portray age.
- Update legacy email address (Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc.).
- Don't go back more than 15 years on job history.
  - Not even soft skills age well and any tech you were working on back then is probably not still relevant.
- Make sure non-tech social media accounts are private. (They can still usually see your profile pic.)

### Other Discrimination

- Never include a photo - used only for discrimination
- Geographical location not always necessary
- Political activities - abstract the exact political cause/party
- Keep personal life out of your application materials
